                    <p>

When I came to San Francisco for the first time, I knew already that the tech industry was what I wanted to embrace. 

<p>It was two years ago. 

<h2>From journalism to tech</h2>

<p>My studies in Political Science at <a href"http://www.sciencespo.fr/en">Sciences Po Paris</a> and La Sorbonne in France, and my appeal to media and their ability to act on people, had led me to have work experiences in Political Journalism. There, I realized that these type of media were not taking into consideration the new and innovative formats offered by the Web and mobile to distribute, organize and gather information and data. </p>

<p>My one-year journey in San Francisco, working as an Analyst for <a href ="http://www.atelier.net/en">the innovation lab</a> of a French company made me get deeper into this world full of promises. In twelve months, I got a big and complete picture of what the Silicon Valley had to offer and will probably be offering for the next years. I also connected with a lot of inspiring people. Especially, I took part in the organisation of a <a href="http://transmediasf.startupweekend.org/">Startup Weekend</a> hackathon, dedicated to transmedia projects. I had manifested a great interest in this new narrative form called transmedia, for quite a time. Transmedia storytelling corresponds to the ability to tell a story across different platforms. And I really thought that knowing more about this storytelling process coupled with the technology underlying it, would be a great asset for my future professional life.</p>

<p>Back in France a few months after, I got into the process of creation and conception of products, thanks to a position as a Producer in a <a href="http://smallbang.fr/">Transmedia Studio</a>. This experience also allowed me to understand the whole process of creation of a product, its issues and how to handle them. </p>

<h2>Games can have a purpose</h2>

<p>Working among all on a video game, I gathered a lot of conclusions about this medium. Its powerful capability of retention, its ability to act on people's behaviors since the player is an actor more than in any other medium, or its development on mobile and the brand new audience to address this was opening. More than anything else, I was convinced that video games had been trusted by the entertainment industry for 25 years, defining a great part of their identity. And that we were at a crucial time for use for other purposes. I have been very much inspired by some of my readings and among all <a href="http://janemcgonigal.com/my-book/"><i>Reality is Broken</i></a> by Jane McGonigal. This book strengthened my belief that games can influence our behaviors, making the world a better place. </p>

<p>First, video games could be dedicated to serve other goals than pure fun, but using fun for people to care more about their health, the well-being of their city and so on. What had been tried by serious games for some time, had to be done with a real know how from people who know how to make great games. </p>
<p>Second, I am convinced that the engagement and virality that any consumer app wants to gather can be very well attained through gamified processes. For this, I think that <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a> and <a href="http://www.gotinder.com/">Tinder</a> are of the most successful ones. </p>

<p>Having to finish my Master a few months after this, I came back to school knowing that I wanted to take a step further in the creation and conception, mostly to understand fully how a product is constructed.</p>

<h2>MakeGamesWithUs and the will to create</h2>

<p>It had been a year that I had started learning coding on the side. Mostly web development. I also knew that I wanted to come back to San Francisco, the best place for me to continue on this path. I had heard about <a href="https://www.makegameswith.us/summer-academy/">MakeGamesWithUs</a> before, since I had met Jeremy and Ashu when I was in San Francisco. I then decided to enroll for two months and develop with my own hands my iPhone game. 
It was a tremendous experience. I really enjoyed programing and I will definitely keep it as an asset on top of my previous background. Coding its own product is a very rewarding process since you build what you want and see it appear along the way. </p>

<p>I am now fully open to either continue working on mobile gaming to further learn about it. Or to use gaming as a tool to engage people and build “games with a purpose”.
